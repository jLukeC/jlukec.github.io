        <p>Hi I’m Luke Carlson, a masters student at the University of Pennsylvania focusing on <a href="#">Machine Learning</a>: <a href="#">NLP</a>, and <a href="#">Machine Translation</a>. My interests in technology have led me to dabble in many fields (you can check out my projects below) and I love
            the challenge of creating solutions to hard hitting problems. I started a <a href="http://enclave.design">freelance tech consulting firm</a> to become more exposed to people’s real world problems which has led me to understand the power of machine learning.</p>

        <p>I finished my undergrad at Penn this past May and spent the summer traveling through eastern and western Europe before returning to finish up my masters. I’m a huge consumer of movies and books — recent reads include Sapiens, A Mind at Play and
            the Gene and I just watched Kagemusha, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, Little Hours, and Shot Caller.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions or want to reach out, feel free to email me at jlukecarlson@gmail.com</p>

    <p><em>Teaching Experience</em></p>
    <p> This is my fourth year in a teaching role at Penn - currently I am a TA for Penn’s graduate course on <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis521/">artificial intelligence</a>. I was the head project manager (organizational role) for a graduate course on <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cdmurphy/cis573/">software
        design and engineering principles</a> (ie agile and test-driven development for Android, design patterns, interfacing with clients) for two years and previously taught for a course on <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis120/">programming languages and techniques</a> (ie functional programming
        in OCaml, data structures, abstraction).</p>

    <p><em>Professional Experience</em> </p>
    <p>I run a freelance tech consultancy called <a href="http://enclave.design">Enclave</a>, with a focus on web development and data science. Over the years I’ve been a Program Manager Intern at <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/"> Microsoft on the Visual C++ team</a>, Product Manager at <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/03/30/beautiful-code">Ruse Labs</a>,
        and a Software Engineering Intern at <a href="http://appboy.com">Appboy</a>.</p>
